# ArduinoTimer

ArduinoTimer is a library that allows you to create and manage asynchronous timers.

It is useful for creating timers that run in the background without blocking the main loop. The timers can be invoked once or repeatedly at a fixed interval.

The sample code in the `examples` directory demonstrates the usage of this library.
